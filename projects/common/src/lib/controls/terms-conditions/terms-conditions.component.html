              which is used to send your Content to Fathym. &nbsp;By installing and using the Fathym Products, you
              agree to the subscription agreement, data plan, and service provider as laid out in your Purchase
              Agreement for such Fathym Products. Fathym Products are covered under the Product’s <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ENi9bhJJmuHwCvnNxgNUZ7uNy_Us1afxiM86gS7d8EE/edit?usp=sharing">Limited
                Warranty</a>. Fathym Products are non-transferable, and only meant for the vehicles applicable under
              the Purchase Agreement. &nbsp;Subject to this Agreement and any Purchase Agreement accompanying the
              Products, Fathym will provide you with a limited right to access and use the Site, Applications, and
              Services through the Products. &nbsp;All access to and use of any firmware, software, or other
              Technology (as defined below) included in, installed on, or incorporated into the Products is subject to
              the terms of this Agreement and may be used solely as installed on the Products in connection with the
              normal operation of the Products. &nbsp;Fathym reserves the right to access the Products or any other
              portion of the Fathym Platform as needed to update, upgrade, or modify the firmware or other software
              installed on, or incorporated into the Products. &nbsp;By using the Products, you agree to such updates.
              &nbsp;Products should only be installed by a trained professional or following the Fathym installation
              guide. &nbsp;Fathym is not responsible for any issues that may arise from incorrect Product
              installation.</li>
            <li><b>To Sites and Services</b><br>Subject to this Agreement, during the term of this Agreement, Fathym
              will provide you with a limited right to access and use the Site and Services under this Agreement.
              &nbsp;If you have purchased Fathym Products under a Purchase Agreement, all access to the Site and all
              Services will be solely by you for your own use in connection with your use of and access to the
              Products that you have purchased under a Purchase Agreement. &nbsp;If you are an entity or other
              organization, then your employees and contractors may also use the Site and Services on your behalf in
              connection with your internal business purposes. &nbsp;Your rights to access and use the Site and
              Services is non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable. Fathym offers a variety of upgraded
              hosting, support, and consulting Services under the terms and conditions for each such service. &nbsp;By
              signing up for an upgraded Service account, you agree to abide by such additional terms and conditions
              in addition to this Agreement.</li>
            <li><b>To Applications<br></b>The Products may come pre-loaded with a proprietary Fathym Application. If
              you have obtained a Smart Hub without a Fathym Application pre-loaded, you are responsible for sending
              the Smart Hub to Fathym for Application installation or downloading the Application on your own.
              &nbsp;Subject to your compliance with this Agreement and any other terms and conditions accompanying
              each Application, Fathym will permit you to download and install Applications and operate those
              Applications solely for the purpose of using and accessing the Smart Hub, Sites, and Services as
              intended by Fathym. &nbsp;Fathym is not responsible for any errors or damage that may arise by
              installing an Application on your own. &nbsp;The Application connects to the Fathym Products, and may
              provide you with alerts and notifications. &nbsp;You may only use Applications for your own personal and
              non-commercial purposes in accordance with this Agreement and any applicable terms and conditions
              accompanying the Application or otherwise provided to you by Fathym. &nbsp;Except as expressly set forth
              in the previous sentence, you are granted no licenses or other rights in or to any Application or any
              IPR (as defined below) therein or related thereto. &nbsp;You agree not to use, modify, reproduce,
              perform, display, create derivative works from, republish, post, transmit, participate in the transfer
              or sale of, distribute, or in any way exploit or utilize any Application other than as expressly
              permitted in this Agreement or any other agreement you are required to agree to before being given
              access to any Application.</li>
            <li><b>To Alerts and Notifications<br></b>You may sign up for custom alerts and notifications through the
              Fathym Platform based on your data. &nbsp;Fathym does its best to ensure that alerts and notifications
              operate as expected and with full accuracy, but it cannot guarantee performance. &nbsp;These alerts and
              notifications should not replace common sense or other life-saving warnings.</li>
            <li><b>To Other Users<br></b>You may be permitted to link, connect, and otherwise communicate with other
              users and third parties through the Fathym Platform. &nbsp;By linking, connecting, or communicating with
              other users or third parties, you are agreeing to allow those users to communicate directly with you
              through the Fathym Platform. You are solely responsible for all communications between you and any other
              user or third party through the Fathym Platform. &nbsp;Your extension or acceptance of a link,
              connection or other communication with another user or other third party will serve as your affirmative
              “opt in” to the disclosure by Fathym of any data, information, or content (which may include your
              personally identifiable information) that communicate to that user or third party.</li>
            <li><b>To Third-Party Services<br></b>The Fathym Platform may provide you with the choice to access
              services developed, provided, or maintained by third-party service providers of Fathym (“<b>Third Party
                Services</b>”). &nbsp;Unless otherwise stated in this Agreement, Fathym has no control over, is not
              responsible for, and does not provide support for, any Third Party Services. &nbsp;In addition to the
              terms of this Agreement, your access to and use of any Third Party Service is also subject to any other
              agreement you may agree to before being given access to the Third Party Service (each, a “<b>Third Party
                Service Agreement</b>”). The terms of any Third Party Service Agreement (which may include payment of
              additional fees) will apply to the applicable Third Party Services provided under that Third Party
              Service Agreement in addition to the terms of this Agreement but will not apply to any other Services
              provided by Fathym that you may access through the Fathym Platform. &nbsp;Except as set forth in this
              Agreement, the terms of any Third Party Service Agreement will control in the event of a conflict
              between the terms of this Agreement and that Third Party Service Agreement.</li>

        <li><b>Restrictions<br></b>The Fathym Platform and the software, firmware, hardware, databases, and other
          technology used by or on behalf of Fathym to provide the Products, Site, and Applications and their
          structure, organization, coordination, and underlying data, information, and source code (collectively, the

          intended to restrict access to any portion of the Technology; (10) alter or misrepresent the identification
          of the origin of any Content transmitted through the Fathym Platform; or (11) interfere in any manner with
          the operation or hosting of the Fathym Platform or Technology, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to the
          Fathym Platform or Technology. You will not allow any access to or use of the Technology except consistent

              in connection with a purchase or transaction of an Upgrade, purchases or other transactions made by you
              through the Solution cannot be exchanged and any fees or charges in connection with those purchases or
